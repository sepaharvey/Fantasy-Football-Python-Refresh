        "Thus far, we've ran for loops on lists, which we know are considered iterable. Another kind of iterable Python object is a range. In Python, there are many types of iterables. The range function we call here which takes in two arguments is actually one of Python's built-in functions. It can actually take in three arguments, `start` , `stop` , and `step`. The range function simply gives us back a range of numbers that can be iterated over. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is an example of a range of numbers, with a starting point of 1, an ending position of 6 (this isn't a typo!), and a step of 1. The first argument, `star`t, is the starting number for our range. We simply give it the number we want to start counting at. The second argument is the ending position for our range. Notice we did not specify ending number, we specified ending position. Recall how list indexes start at 0 and end at the length of the list - 1, meaning that the last item in the list will have an index of the length of the list - 1. Same thing going on here. We are specifying our ending position, but we need to specify one more than what we actually want. For example, if we wanted a range from 1 to 5 going like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we would need to specify range(1, 6) . That's going to be a bit tricky to learn initially but eventually it will become second nature.\n",
